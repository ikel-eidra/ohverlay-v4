## Problem Statement

### The Digital Wellness Crisis

Modern knowledge workers face unprecedented challenges:
- **73%** report feeling burned out (Gallup, 2024)
- **Average 96 interruptions per day** from digital tools
- **52 minutes** to regain focus after interruption
- **$1 trillion** annual cost of workplace burnout globally

Current solutions (productivity apps, blockers, trackers) often ADD to digital clutter rather than reducing it.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution Type | Problem |
|--------------|---------|
| Website Blockers | Too aggressive, breaks flow |
| Time Trackers | Surveillance feel, anxiety-inducing |
| Notification Managers | Still interruptive |
| Physical Solutions | Impractical, forgotten |

**The Gap:** A solution that is PRESENT but not INTRUSIVE, CALM but EFFECTIVE.

## Our Solution: Ohverlay

### Core Concept

Ohverlay places a lifelike AI Betta fish (named "Uno") on users' desktop monitors. The fish:

1. **Swims naturally** across multi-monitor setups using procedural animation
2. **Observes work patterns** (respectfully, locally, privately)
3. **Delivers wellness reminders** via gentle floating bubbles
4. **Respects focus time** through "Sanctuary Mode"

### Key Features

#### 🐟 ZenFish - AI Betta Companion
- **Procedural Animation:** Perlin noise + physics for natural movement
- **Personality Engine:** LLM-powered (Claude/OpenAI) for contextual messaging
- **Multi-Monitor:** Seamlessly swims across 2-3+ screens
- **Click-Through:** Works behind windows, no interference

#### 💭 Intelligent Bubble System
| Bubble Type | Trigger | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Health | Sedentary detection | "Time to stretch? 🌿" |
| Love Notes | Telegram/WhatsApp | "💕 New message from Sarah" |
| Schedule | Calendar integration | "Meeting in 15 min 📅" |
| News | User preference | "Market update: S&P +1.2%" |

#### 🏝️ Sanctuary Mode
- Invisible boundaries during focus time
- Hotkey toggle (Ctrl+Alt+S)
- No bubbles during deep work
- Fish stays in peripheral areas
