Ohverlay is a calm, semi-transparent desktop overlay companion ecosystem. The current runtime experience is **ZenFish Overlay**: a lifelike betta fish that swims across your monitor space without interrupting your workflow.

> Focus right now: **Ohverlay + ZenFish muna** — relaxation, practicality, and ethics first.

## Overview
ZenFish is designed as a quiet companion for productivity-heavy workflows. It gives ambient presence, subtle supportive prompts, and natural fish behavior while staying non-intrusive and user-controlled.

## Current Key Features
- **Lifelike Betta Rendering**: Uno-inspired purple betta styling with procedural animation and glow.
- **Multi-Monitor Overlay**: Smooth movement across one or more screens.
- **Click-Through UX**: Transparent overlay that does not block your normal desktop interaction.
- **Symbolic Pellet Interaction**: `Ctrl+Alt+F` drops pellets where the user points, and fish responds while **continuing to swim** (no hard stop/feed dependency).
- **Calm Integrations**: Bubble-based modules for health, schedule, love notes, and news.
- **Optional LLM Brain**: Anthropic/OpenAI support with graceful fallback behavior when unavailable.
