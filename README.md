## 🌌 Overview

**Project Aether** (ZenFish) is an intelligent, non-intrusive desktop overlay that brings life to your workspace. What started as a simple swimming fish has evolved into a fully agentic companion capable of managing your schedule, monitoring your health, and providing intelligent assistance—all while swimming peacefully on your screen.

**Version 2** marks a complete re-imagining of the core architecture, designed for:
*   **Modular Intelligence:** A new plugin-based brain.
*   **Hyper-Realistic Fluidity:** Enhanced physics and swimming behaviors.
*   **Deep Integration:** Seamless connection with your OS and workflows.
